🚛 Export Plan Optimization

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing the export logistics plan for Danone, specifically for an existing product, Actimel, and a new product line. The new product will use the same logistics infrastructure, making it necessary to develop an integrated logistics strategy. The goal is to create a unified export plan that maximizes efficiency, minimizes delays, and reduces overall costs.

The project aims to integrate production and distribution processes to streamline operations and enhance logistical efficiency. By analyzing the similarities between the two products, the logistics plan will ensure that resources are utilized optimally, improving overall supply chain performance. 📦

🔍 Key Aspects of the Project

📊 Logistics Analysis

A detailed analysis of the current logistics framework for Actimel will be conducted, identifying key processes, routes, and cost factors. This analysis will help pinpoint inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement.

🔄 Integration Strategy

Developing an integration strategy that allows the new product's logistics to be efficiently merged with the existing system. This ensures that both product lines can be managed without disruptions while maintaining a high level of efficiency.

🏗 Implementation Plan

A structured implementation plan will be created, outlining the necessary steps to transition into the optimized logistics system. This includes setting timelines, allocating resources, and identifying potential risks with corresponding mitigation strategies.
